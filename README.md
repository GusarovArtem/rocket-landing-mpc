## 📖 Overview

This is an engineering thesis (*praca dyplomowa*) project: land a simulated rocket's returning first stage, autonomously, in 3D — first with a classic **PID** controller, then with a **Model Predictive Control (MPC)** controller built on **CasADi + IPOPT** — and compare the two under disturbances (wind, model mismatch, initial-condition errors).

> **Research question:** To what extent does MPC improve the accuracy and quality of a returning rocket's autonomous landing compared to a baseline PID controller, under limited thrust, model uncertainty, and disturbances?

It's deliberately **not** a 6-DoF, aerodynamically exact rocket simulator — see [Scope & Simplifications](#-scope--simplifications) below. The goal is a physically credible, fully-tested, reproducible GNC (Guidance, Navigation & Control) pipeline, not a maximally realistic one.

Design principle (from the original brief): **dynamics never depends on the controller, and the controller never depends on visualization** — so PID can be swapped for MPC without touching the simulator.

## 🛠️ Tech stack

| Tool | Role |
| --- | --- |
| **Python 3.14** | implementation language |
| **NumPy / SciPy** | numerics, integration |
| **CasADi + IPOPT** | symbolic modeling & nonlinear optimization for MPC |
| **Matplotlib** | time-series & 3D trajectory plots |
| **pytest** | automated physics/controller/metrics tests |

## 🎯 Scope & simplifications

**Included:** 3D translational dynamics, variable mass (fuel burn via Isp), bounded thrust, bounded thrust-tilt angle, gravity.

**Explicitly excluded (by design, not yet):**
- No aerodynamic drag (stretch goal, step 49)
- No 6-DoF body-orientation dynamics — thrust direction is steered directly as a unit vector, no attitude control (stretch goal, step 50)
- No propellant slosh, body flexibility, or engine turbomachinery
- No real planet physics (no Earth rotation/Coriolis, no real atmosphere) — flat local frame, constant gravity
- Vehicle parameters are a plausible **educational "toy" rocket**, not a real one (e.g. not Falcon 9 data)

Full rationale: [`docs/assumptions.md`](docs/assumptions.md) ([English](docs/assumptions.en.md)).

## ▶️ Running it

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
pytest tests/ -v
```

(Plotting scripts under `scripts/` are run individually, e.g. `python scripts/plot_profile.py`, and open a Matplotlib window.)
