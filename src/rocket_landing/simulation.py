    """
    First CLOSED-LOOP simulation: unlike simulate() (step 19), which used
    one FIXED control the whole way through, this recomputes the thrust
    at EVERY single step, by asking `pid` how far off the current
    vertical speed (vz) is from the target (0 - we want to stop, not
    fall). alpha and beta are kept at 0 the whole time - motion is
    vertical-only on purpose, exactly as this step's tittle says. Full
    3D closed-loop control (horizontal PID too) comes in step 26-27.


    Why "hover_thrust" + correction" instead of just "correction":
    gravity alone requires 'mass * g' newtons of thrust just to stand
    still (see the hover test from step 12). If the PID's output were
    used AS the thrust directly, it would have to re-learn "flight
    gravity" from scratch via the error - by instead giving it a head
    start at the hover point and only asking it to supply the REST (the
    correction needed to kill the remaining vz), the PID's job becomes
    much simpler: pure error-connection, not "also hold up the entire
    rocket". This is a common, standard PID-control trick, not specific
    to rockets.
